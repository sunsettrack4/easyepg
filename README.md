## Modify XML files
One of the most important features is the modification of XML files.
This option allows you to combine channels from multiple sources, and to run additional scripts before/after final XML file creation.

* currently supported: RATING MAPPER and NEW IMDB MAPPER
#### 3) ADD/MODIFY PRE SHELL SCRIPT
* run a shell script before starting the addon scripts
#### 4) ADD/MODIFY POST SHELL SCRIPT
* start a shell script after running the addon scripts
#### 5) CREATE CHANNEL LIST AS TXT FILE
* create a channel list with TVG-IDs of the created XML file
* the file will be stored in "XML" folder
#### 6) TIME PERIOD
* select the time range (0 = disable, up to 14 days)
#### 7) RUN COMBINE SCRIPT
* run the combine script of the selected environment without updating the EPG database
#### 9) REMOVE THIS SETUP
